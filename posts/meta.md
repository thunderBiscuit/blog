## How it is made

This blog was build from scratch using Gatsby and GraphQL. Plenty of people were really awesome to me when I first started learning about Gatsby and React; if you have a question pertaining to how I built any of this, don't hesitate to shoot me a message on twitter.

The repo for this website is also public, and lives <a href="https://github.com/thunderBiscuit/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
