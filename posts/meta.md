## Why this blog

I write about stuff I learn, and stuff I wish I knew more about. If you have comments or questions or want to bounce ideas about anything on here, you should totally [DM me on twitter](), or send me an email at thunderB@protonmail.com.

## How is it made

This blog was build from scratch using Gatsby and GraphQL. I am in the process of transforming it into a Gatsby theme so it can easily be reused. Plenty of people were really awesome to me when I first started learning about Gatsby and React; if you have a question pertaining to how I built any of this, don't hesitate to shoot me a message on twitter.
